Diceroller


Diceroller is a simple and interactive command-line Python program that simulates rolling one or two dice. The game lets the player choose whether to roll one die or two dice and provides the results in a clear, easy-to-read format. It also asks the player if they want to roll the dice again after each round, providing an endless loop until the player decides to quit.

This project demonstrates the use of basic Python functionalities such as loops, conditionals, functions, and random number generation, making it a great practice exercise for Python beginners.
How It Works

    User Input: The game starts by asking the player how many dice they would like to roll (either 1 or 2).
    Dice Roll Simulation: Based on the player's input, the program generates a random number between 1 and 6 for each die, simulating a real-life dice roll.
    Display Results: The rolled values are then displayed, along with the total if two dice are rolled.
    Repeat or Exit: After each roll, the game asks the player if they want to roll the dice again. The game continues in a loop until the player decides to stop by typing "no."

Features

    Roll one or two dice.
    Get random values between 1 and 6, just like in real dice rolls.
    A looping mechanism allows players to roll the dice multiple times without restarting the program.
    Simple and intuitive interface with minimal user input.
    Clear screen after each roll to give a fresh display for each round.
