# RollDice
The Roll-a-Dice game in Python is a beginner project that simulates rolling a six-sided dice. It uses the random module to generate numbers between 1 and 6, showing the result to the player. Players can choose to roll again or quit. This simple game teaches loops, conditionals, and user input handling, making it great for learning Python basics.
